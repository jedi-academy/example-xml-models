# example-xml-models

These are some sample XML documents, and sample CodeIgniter components that would be 
appropriate for working with the XML data.

The numbered folders have read-only models, to process the different data 
structures appropriately. They all deal with the same data, just differently
structured :)

The properties folder is patterned after java.util.properties,
namely a collection of key/value pairs that you might handy for storing
application configuration data without the overhead of an RDB.
