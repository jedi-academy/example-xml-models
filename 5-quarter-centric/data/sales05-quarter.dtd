<!--
DTD for sales05-quarter.xml.
The data is structured by vehicle type sales, within country, per quarter

<!-- The root element, which should contain quarter elements, one per
quarter for a year.
The data comes from Industry Canada, and is for 2010.
There could be more data, and past data, so it makes sense to constrain 
the year attribute.
 -->
<!ELEMENT sale (quarter)+>

<!--- Each quarter is for a specific year, and contains multiple country elements,
each of which will hold the sales data for a single country for that quarter. -->
<!ELEMENT quarter (country)*>
<!ATTLIST quarter
    number  (1|2|3|4)   #REQUIRED
    year    CDATA   #REQUIRED
>

<!-- Each country contains a number of vehicle elements, one per
vehicle type. -->
<!ELEMENT country (vehicle)*>
<!ATTLIST country
    name (Canada|Mexico|U.S.) #REQUIRED
  >

<!--- Each vehicle element contains the quarterly sales for a specific
type of vehicle. 
I have not changed the original XML, which means that we cannot constrain the 
vehicle type with an enumerated list - the data contains spaces and slashes. -->
<!ELEMENT vehicle (#PCDATA)>
