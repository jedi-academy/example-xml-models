<!-- The root element contains a year element, and then multiple sorce elements,
each of which models data from a country.
The data comes from Industry Canada, and is for 2010.
There could be more data, and past data, so it makes sense to constrain 
the year attribute.
 -->
<!ELEMENT sales (year,source+)>

<!--- year element holds the year that this data set pertains to -->
<!ELEMENT year (#PCDATA)>

<!--- A source element contains a country element (where the data came from),
and then multiple vehicles elements, one per type of vehicle -->
<!ELEMENT source (country,vehicles+)>

<!--- Name of the country the data is from -->
<!ELEMENT country (#PCDATA)>

<!--- A type element (kind of vehicle), followed by a number
of sold elements, one per quarter. -->
<!ELEMENT vehicles (type,sold+)>

<!--- Vehicle type.
Note that we cannot constrain its value. -->
<!ELEMENT type (#PCDATA)>

<!--- Sales for a quarter -->
<!ELEMENT sold (#PCDATA)>
